# The Vehicle Quiz Game

The Vehicle quiz game is a simple quiz game based on vehicles(mostly cars ofcourse). It is a very color rich game 

![Responsive Mockup](documentation/testing/ami-responsive.png)

From the Responsive Mockup image used above, it is clear that the view port of the mobile device used which is an older iphone model is very small hence the reason why the home screen might not look very responsive. The image below shows a view of the home screen from my peronal mobile device which is a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra.

## UX

### Color Scheme

I chose to go with a dark theme through out the site to express to the user a sense of professionalism and seriousness about fitness. The background images used throughout the site help to showcase the enthusiasm of gym members in general, the quality of equipments and gym floors available, and the 'no nonsense' vibe and energy surrounding the entire gym atmosphere. The red accents used throughout the site help to highlight important aspects of each page like the red buttonts and active red navigation links. All the background images used have a linear gradient opacity over them in order to make the content on them stand out even more.

### Typography

I chose to use the font called Roboto Condensed from Google fonts throughout the website because it is a bold and striking font that evokes a sense of fun and passion.

### Wireframes

Below are sketched images of how I planned to layout the website design. You will notice that the final design of the website is slightly different from my initial sketches for some pages like the about page. I felt the initial design of the About page would be too clustered not allowing enough room for te text message that is on the final product. And also I decided to go with using pricing cards instead of conventional tables on the Membership page because I felt the pricing Cards  were more informative and simpler to understand making it easier for the user to make an informed decision on which plan to go for as quickly as possible.
